<p>Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: <a href="http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har">http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har</a> (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). </p>

<a id="project-implementation-details" class="anchor" href="#project-implementation-details" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Implementation Details</h3>

<p>The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which the group of enthusiasts did exercise. R has been used to implement the project. Since the dataset has a large number of variables, appropriate feature selection needs to be done. Before that, parallel processing in R needs to be set up. It is done as follows.</p>

<pre lang="library(doParallel)"><code>cl &lt;- makeCluster(detectCores())
registerDoParallel(cl)
</code></pre>

<p>The input file is now loaded and unnecessary features are filtered out. These include columns with over 80% NA values, #DIV/0! values, timestamp, user name, window and summary statistics specific values.</p>

<p>`trainfile &lt;- read.csv("pml-training.csv")</p>

<p>trainSub &lt;- trainfile[ , (colSums(is.na(trainfile)) &lt;= 0.8*nrow(trainfile))]</p>

<p>trainSub &lt;- trainSub[,(colSums(trainSub[,] == "#DIV/0!")) == 0]`</p>

<p>The input file is now loaded and unnecessary features are filtered out. These include columns with over 80% NA values, #DIV/0! values, timestamp, user name, window and summary statistics specific values.</p>
