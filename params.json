{"name":"Exercise Method Prediction Using Random Forests","tagline":"Random Forest Prediction Modelling on Wearable Device Data","body":"### Background\r\nUsing devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). \r\n\r\n### Data \r\nThe training data for this project are available here: \r\n\r\nhttps://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv\r\n\r\nThe test data are available here: \r\n\r\nhttps://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv\r\n\r\nThe data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment. \r\n\r\n### Project Implementation Details\r\nThe goal of the project is to predict the manner in which the group of enthusiasts did exercise. R has been used to implement the project. Since the dataset has a large number of variables, appropriate feature selection needs to be done. Before that, parallel processing in R needs to be set up. It is done as follows.\r\n`library(doParallel)`    \r\n\r\n`cl <- makeCluster(detectCores())`\r\n\r\n`registerDoParallel(cl)`\r\n\r\nThe input file is now loaded and unnecessary features are filtered out. These include columns with over 80% NA values, #DIV/0! values, timestamp, user name, window and summary statistics specific values.\r\n\r\n`trainfile <- read.csv(\"pml-training.csv\")\r\n\r\ntrainSub <- trainfile[ , (colSums(is.na(trainfile)) <= 0.8*nrow(trainfile))]\r\n\r\ntrainSub <- trainSub[,(colSums(trainSub[,] == \"#DIV/0!\")) == 0]`\r\n\r\nThe input file is now loaded and unnecessary features are filtered out. These include columns with over 80% NA values, #DIV/0! values, timestamp, user name, window and summary statistics specific values.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
